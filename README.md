Kaggle Enefit Final Notebook.  

Tabular data modelled with an voting regressor ensemble of LGBMs.

This was my first time series modelling competition.  It was quite challenging and I spent a lot of time debugging the code just to get a working submission, but also learned a lot of hard lessons, which are the good kind of lessons I suppose.  

Also my first intro to using Polars instead of Pandas.  I think I might stick with that, it seems pretty good.

I have used much smaller and faster models than most people, my CV scheme was suggesting that this was optimal, but I'm not convinced that my CV scheme was very reliable, so that's probably the root cause of my troubles.

Currently in 1020th place, so I guess I'm not going to win this time!  But still somewhat hopefull that when the private leaderboard is revealed I might zoom past the public notebooks, which I suspect are over-fitted to the leaderboard.
